# Welcome

Hello and welcome! Whether you're a backend engineer, architect, curious student, or someone navigating the tangled world of databases in web applications and microservices — this book is for you.

You'll find _real-world lessons_, _hard-earned advice_, and _common traps_ to avoid when designing, integrating, and scaling relational databases in modern systems.

This book isn’t here to teach you how to write a `CREATE TABLE` statement — it’s here to help you understand why your last migration caused a production outage, or why your query plan exploded in cost, or why your microservice's database should _not_ talk to six others.

I have organized the content into digestible chapters, practical examples, and recurring patterns (like the Outbox Pattern) to help you build systems that are resilient, predictable, and sane to debug.

Feel free to jump around, highlight, annotate, or argue with the material — and if you find something helpful (or something wrong), I welcome contributions and feedback.

Enjoy the journey — your future systems (and teammates) will thank you.
