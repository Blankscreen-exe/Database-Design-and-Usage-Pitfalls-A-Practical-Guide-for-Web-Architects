# Preface

In the ever-evolving world of software engineering, one thing remains constant: **data is at the heart of every application**. Whether you're building a simple web app or orchestrating a distributed system of microservices, your data layer—if not thoughtfully designed—can become your greatest liability.

Over the years, I’ve seen brilliant applications stumble, not because of poor business logic or bad UI design, but because of avoidable mistakes in how data was modelled, accessed, and managed. These failures weren’t due to lack of intelligence—they were due to lack of **awareness**. There’s a lot written about algorithms and frontend frameworks, but comparatively little accessible material that speaks honestly and practically about the **pitfalls of working with databases in real-world applications**.

This book is my attempt to fill that gap.

You won’t find academic database theory here, nor will this be a deep dive into a specific SQL dialect. Instead, you’ll find battle-tested guidance, stories of real-world failures, and practical patterns for designing, using, and scaling databases within the context of modern web and microservice architectures. From subtle schema issues to systemic architectural flaws, from connection pool misconfigurations to broken consistency guarantees across distributed systems—this book exists to help you recognize the red flags _before_ they cost you time, money, and reliability.

I wrote this book for software engineers, architects, DevOps professionals, and technical leaders who care deeply about building resilient, maintainable systems. Whether you’re early in your career or have built systems that handle millions of users, this book will challenge you to **think holistically about your database choices**, and how they influence the reliability and scalability of the software you deliver.

We’ll also explore architectural patterns like the **Outbox Pattern**, **CQRS**, and **Saga orchestration**, which help bridge the gap between your database and the rest of your ecosystem. But more than patterns, this book aims to give you **principles**—so that when you inevitably face a situation not covered here, you’ll be able to reason through it with clarity and confidence.

If you’ve ever wondered:

* “Why is this query suddenly slow?”
* “Should each service have its own database?”
* “How do I publish events reliably from a transaction?”
* “Why did our system go down because of a missing index?”\
  —then you’re in the right place.

I hope this handbook saves you from painful mistakes, sharpens your intuition, and empowers you to build better systems. Let’s dive in.
