# Chapter Overview

In this chapter we will touch on some basic level stuff like normalization, denormalization, redundancy, integrity etc. Of course, this book is not about basic database concepts. So we will not be going into much depth in these basic topics. Instead, we are going to directly jump on _how to utilize_ these fairy tales we learned about in university and actually implement them in real live systems.
